// Per-scan memoization for repository-root-keyed work (Git context, future per-root metadata).
//
// Why an explicit object rather than a module-level Map: the cache MUST NOT outlive one scan. A
// process-lifetime cache would pin the first branch/dirty reading a long-lived portal ever took and
// report it forever. Making the cache an object the caller creates and drops makes that lifetime a
// property of the code shape instead of a rule someone has to remember.
//
// Domain-neutral on purpose. Runtime is the first consumer, but "cache work keyed by repository
// root for the duration of one scan" is not a Runtime concept — Plans, Telemetry, and Doctor all
// resolve roots too, and a second copy in modules/developer-runtime/ is exactly the duplicate resolver
// code the canonical-repository-identity migration removed.

    // their own (the value is only settled once, so a late caller still gets the same result).
