// Retention policy: the shared vocabulary for "what is stale, and how much has to go".
//
// This module holds no I/O. It defines the policy shape, validates it, and turns raw measurements
// into a verdict. log-store.mjs and file-set-store.mjs do the reading; the store itself does the
// writing. That three-way split is the point of the module: before it, developer-runtime and the
// telemetry spool each had their own cutoff arithmetic, their own constants, and their own idea of
// when the work was worth doing — and the two disagreed in ways that were partly deliberate and
// partly accidental, which could only be told apart by reading both in full.
//
// What deliberately does NOT live here is the commit. A whole-file reader needs a temp-file rename;
// a reader holding a byte cursor needs an in-place shrink it can detect. Those are correctness
// requirements of each store's reader, not policy, so each store keeps its own.
