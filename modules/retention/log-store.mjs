//
// The gate below is the reason this module exists rather than each store calling dropCountForBytes
// directly. Retention almost never has anything to do, and finding that out must not cost a full
// read+parse of a 25MB file on every append. developer-runtime had this ladder; the spool did not, and
// stat'd then rewrote wholesale whenever it tripped.

//   2. cap check       — over the hard cap, skip straight to the full read
//   3. head probe      — parse only the oldest record; if it is inside the window, so is everything
//                        after it, because records are appended in time order
//   4. full read       — only now pay for parsing every line
