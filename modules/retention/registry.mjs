// One registry so that adding a store means one entry here rather than a new hand-rolled cap plus a
// new doctor check plus a new CLI branch. `maintenance stores`, the doctor checks, and the portal
// Monitoring row all read this.

// modules/developer-runtime/history.mjs and settingsPathFor in its settings.mjs. That is what makes the
// whole registry testable against a temp directory with no environment juggling.

// must have at least one non-null bound; assertBounded enforces it and the test asserts it, which
