// Names are matched as whole tokens (see nameTokens in member-role.mjs), never as substrings, so a
// short entry like `meta` or `auth` cannot claim `metabase` or `oauth-demo`. Titles are matched as
// case-insensitive substrings, because a page title is prose rather than an identifier.

// no Compose service label, so its containers are named `supabase_<service>_<project>`.
