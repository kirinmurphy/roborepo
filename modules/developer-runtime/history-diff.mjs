// Derive transition events by comparing two consecutive snapshots.
//
// This lives in the module layer rather than inline in scripts/cli/developer-runtime.mjs because the
// comparison rules ARE the event semantics — six types, each with its own definition of "changed".
// As a pure function it is testable against two literal snapshot objects; inlined next to the
// lastSnapshot reference it could only be exercised by stubbing the entire discovery pipeline.
//
// Instances are matched by associationKey, which is port-free and PID-free (see buildMatchSignature
// in instance-shape.mjs). An app that restarts on a new port is therefore the SAME app here, and
// produces an originChange rather than a spurious inactive + firstSeen pair.
