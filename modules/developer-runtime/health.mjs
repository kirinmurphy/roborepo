// Health-state normalization: turn a raw HTTP probe result into one of six stable states.
//
// The module holds NO state. Debouncing is derived — classifyHealth takes the app's previous health
// record and returns the next one, so `previous + probe -> next` is a pure function that a test can
// walk as a sequence. The alternative (a module-level Map keyed by associationKey) would need a
// reset hook to be testable and would spuriously increment counters on the settings-rebuild path in
// scripts/cli/developer-runtime.mjs, which re-derives a snapshot from cached discovery without probing.
//
// The carrier for that previous record is the previous snapshot, which the CLI layer already holds
// as `lastSnapshot`. healthIndexFromSnapshot builds the lookup.
