//
// A manual settings.composeProjects[name].repoPath always wins over the auto-derived working_dir
// label when both exist — repoPath is a deliberate user decision (see settings-schema.mjs) and is
// never silently overridden by a guess. When no manual repoPath exists,
// com.docker.compose.project.working_dir (already present on every container from that project's
// `docker ps` output, no extra subprocess call) is tried instead, but only promoted to a resolved
// identity when resolveIdentity actually found a `.git` (identityKind "git" or "path") —
// "process" is resolveProjectIdentity's safe fallback for "no .git found at all", and promoting
// that would make every compose project pointed at a non-repo directory look resolved. The
// auto-derived path and its resolved identity are never written to settings — only repoPath itself
// is a durable, deliberate association; this stays exactly as ephemeral/scan-cached as git context
// already is.
// A third tier runs when working_dir is absent too: the host paths a project's containers bind-mount
// (see docker-mounts.mjs). Containers started outside `docker compose up` — Supabase CLI is the
// motivating case — carry `com.docker.compose.project` but no working_dir, yet still mount paths
// inside the project directory, so walking up from a bind source finds the same `.git`.
//
// This tier is deliberately the weakest and is marked "auto-bind" rather than "auto" so consumers
// can present it as lower-provenance. Unlike working_dir, which Compose guarantees IS the project
// directory, a bind source guarantees nothing — it could point at a cache dir or a shared volume.
// Two guards keep it honest: the same identityKind !== "process" promotion rule the working_dir tier
// uses, and an agreement requirement (below) when a project's containers disagree about which repo
// they belong to.
// Which checkout, if any, a Compose stack belongs to — decided by what its containers actually
// depend on rather than by where `docker compose up` happened to be typed.
//
// BIND MOUNTS DECIDE. A bind mount is a hard dependency on one checkout's files: the stack cannot
// run without them. A named volume is persisted state that says nothing about which checkout is in
// play, so it is ignored for placement (bindSources already drops it).
//
// working_dir is deliberately NOT consulted here. It still resolves WHICH REPOSITORY a stack
// belongs to (tier 2 above, unchanged), but it must never decide WHICH CHECKOUT — that is the bug
// this exists to fix. A shared database started from whichever worktree you happened to be in would
// otherwise render under that worktree, and `docker compose down` from that row would stop the
// database every other checkout is using.
//
// Classified per Compose PROJECT, never per container: a stack is one `docker compose down` unit.
//
// The three outcomes and why they differ:
//   owned       - mounts land in exactly one checkout; that checkout's files are the dependency.
//                 Mounts that land in NO checkout do not weaken this: real stacks routinely bind
//                 /var/run/docker.sock, /etc/localtime, or a log directory, and requiring every
//                 mount to be inside the checkout would misclassify most ordinary stacks as shared.
//   shared      - mounts land in two or more checkouts (they compete), or bind mounts exist but none
//                 resolves to any known checkout — the repository root itself, or a sibling path.
//                 A positive finding that this is not checkout-specific.
//   unverified  - no bind mounts at all (named volumes only); an ABSENCE of evidence, not a finding
//
// shared and unverified render in the same place but are not the same claim, so the evidence kind
// travels with the result and the card can distinguish them.
