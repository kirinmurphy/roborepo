// Containers started by a tool other than `docker compose up` — Supabase CLI is the case that
// motivated this — get `com.docker.compose.project` but no working_dir, so discovery.mjs's
// auto-derivation has nothing to resolve from. Their bind mounts still point into the project
// directory, which is enough to find the repo (see resolveRepoPathFromMounts in discovery.mjs).
//
// Deliberately a separate call from docker.mjs's `docker ps`: mounts are not in `docker ps` output
// at any --format, so this needs `docker inspect`. One batched call for every container id that
// needs inspecting, not one per container, matching the same "N things, one call" discipline as the
// rest of this module. Callers only inspect containers whose project failed working_dir resolution,
// so the common case makes no call at all.
