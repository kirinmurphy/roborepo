// Pure Gemini CLI Policy Engine TOML render, mirroring permissions-render.mjs's
// claudePermissions/renderCodexConfig for the third provider. No file I/O, no path resolution —
// the provider adapter (scripts/harnesses/gemini/index.mjs) supplies the target directory/paths.
//
// Gemini's Policy Engine (~/.gemini/policies/*.toml, User tier) is the only one of the three
// providers with a real native 3-state decision (allow/deny/ask_user) at the config layer — no
// approximation or session-wide fallback needed, unlike Codex's binary prefix_rule + approval_policy
// fallback. Each manifest behavior/command resolves to exactly one [[rule]].
//
// Tool-name mapping lives in the PROVIDER manifest's extensions.app.toolNameMap
// (globals/harnesses/gemini/provider.json) rather than hardcoded here — it's data (a
// string-to-string translation table), not logic. Distinct from the BEHAVIOR manifest
// (manifests/inventory/agent-permissions.json) every render function below also takes: the
// provider manifest describes Gemini itself, the behavior manifest describes what to render.
// Verified against the installed @google/gemini-cli@0.53.1 bundle's own tool-name constants
// (chunk-2NH5AG3B.js: WRITE_FILE_TOOL_NAME="write_file", EDIT_TOOL_NAME="replace",
// READ_FILE_TOOL_NAME="read_file"), not guessed from docs — this is the complete, exhaustive set
// of write/read tool names Gemini ships, sourced from the binary itself.
