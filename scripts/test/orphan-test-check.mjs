// Every test file under scripts/test/ must be reachable from something that actually runs it:
// the bash suite, the local CI-parity runner, or a CI job directly. A test nothing invokes passes
// forever without asserting anything.
//
// This is not hypothetical. test-install-collisions.sh sat in no test list, which is how an
// uninstall that left files behind survived a full review pass (see commit fcdd2b8). The suite
// reported green the entire time, because the check that would have failed was never called.
//
// A second, quieter version of the same failure: a file registered as a package.json `test:*`
// script is not thereby reachable. The CI/local gate names specific `test:*` scripts, and
// test-cli.sh is its own hand-maintained assert list. A `test:*` entry that nothing calls by
// name is exactly as orphaned as a file with no npm script at all — it just looks covered. So a
// `test:*` script counts as reachable only when a runner references its target file or invokes that
// `test:*` name directly — never merely by existing in package.json.
//
// Files that are deliberately not suite entry points declare themselves in EXEMPT below, each with
// a reason. An exemption is a decision on the record; an orphan is an accident.
