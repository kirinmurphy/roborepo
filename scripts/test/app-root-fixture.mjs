// Shared isolated-app-root fixture for tests that spawn the real CLI.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: appRoot is where roborepo reads built-ins AND writes build output — notably
// generated/<harness>/<rootConfig> (see cli/paths.mjs's rootConfigBaseline). A test that isolates
// only HOME and ROBOREPO_STATE_DIR still has appRoot pointing at the real checkout, so any command
// touching root config writes to TRACKED files, stamping a temp path into
// generated/claude/settings.json. That has reached a merge candidate before.
//
// Four checks previously hand-rolled this, and every copy shared the same two defects: they omitted
// modules/ (scripts/cli imports it, so the CLI dies at import time the moment a test touches
// maintenance-stores or localhoster), and they resolved source paths against process.cwd() rather
// than the repo, so the fixture silently built from the wrong tree when run from elsewhere.
