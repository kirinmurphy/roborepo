# Run the repository test suite under CI-shaped conditions: an empty HOME with no harness content,
# and a PATH carrying no harness executables.
#
# Why this exists: the suite passed 393/393 on the development Mac and failed on the GitHub runner.
# The tests that failed read ambient machine state -- a real ~/.claude, a `claude` on PATH -- instead
# of planting their own fixture. That class of defect is invisible locally by construction, because
# the developer's machine always satisfies the ambient condition. This wrapper reproduces the
# runner's conditions without waiting for a push.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test/hermetic-suite.sh [--quiet|-q]
#
# A test that fails here but passes in a normal run is reading the real HOME or PATH. Fix the test
# by planting its own fixture (see the fake-binary technique in config-synthetic-provider-check.mjs),
# not by relaxing its assertion.
