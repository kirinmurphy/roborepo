// Shared "--dry-run mutates nothing" check.
//
// Every command that accepts --dry-run makes the same promise, and until now each test asserted it
// by hand for the one or two paths that test happened to care about. That catches a leak only when
// somebody thinks to look: `workspace-resources.mjs --dry-run` created the whole workspace scaffold
// (applyWorkspaceAssets threads dryRun into its apply calls, but the validateWorkspace() it calls
// first runs initializeWorkspace() with no dryRun at all) and no test noticed, because no test
// happened to snapshot the workspace root around that particular command.
//
// This snapshots every root a command could plausibly touch, runs it, and re-snapshots. A tree that
// does not exist before and does not exist after is unchanged; a tree that appears is a mutation,
// which is the specific shape the workspace-scaffold leak takes.
//
// hashDirectory covers content, mode, and symlink targets, so this also catches a dry run that
// rewrites a file to identical bytes with different permissions, or retargets a symlink.

// A path's identity: its hash, or a sentinel when it is absent. Absent-vs-present is itself the
// signal for scaffold leaks, so "missing" has to be a comparable value rather than a skip.
//
// Handles files as well as directories. Several watched roots are single files (shell profiles,
// ~/.gitignore_global), and hashDirectory throws ENOTDIR on those — which the catch below would
// have turned into a constant "<unreadable>" on both sides of the comparison, silently making every
// profile change invisible. A watcher that cannot see the file it is watching is worse than no
// watcher, because it reports success.
