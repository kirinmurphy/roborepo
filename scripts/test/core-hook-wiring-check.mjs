// Core hook wiring has a source of truth, and the tracked artifact agrees with it.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES: package hooks declare their wiring in a fragment
// (globals/packages/<id>/hooks-claude.json) that is merged in on enable, so the matcher and command
// have a reviewable source. The hooks roborepo always installs had no such fragment — they existed
// only in generated/claude/settings.json, which `renderClaudeSettings` preserves but does not
// produce. That made the matcher hand-maintained tracked state: editing it was invisible to review,
// and nothing detected a divergence between the fragment-less artifact and what was installed.
//
// The `Read|Write|Edit` matcher is the case that motivated this. It was widened from `Write|Edit`
// by hand, and no check anywhere would have caught it being silently reverted or mistyped.
//
// WHAT THIS ASSERTS, and what it deliberately does not:
//   - every core entry declared in the fragment appears in the tracked artifact, matcher included;
//   - the two hooks that must NOT share a matcher still do not (see below);
//   - it does NOT assert the artifact contains only these entries, because package hooks merge into
//     the same file and their presence depends on which packages are enabled.
