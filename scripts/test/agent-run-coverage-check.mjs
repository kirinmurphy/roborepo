// ROBOREPO DEVELOPMENT CHECK — not a runtime guard, and nothing in the shipped CLI calls it.
//
// Purpose: catch drift between the roborepo CLI's real command surface and the permission
// manifest. Every roborepo namespace should be DELIBERATELY classified — allowlisted as
// read-only (inspect-install), or ask-bucketed as config-mutating (mutate-harness-config).
// A namespace that is neither is not a bug in itself; it is an unreviewed decision, and the
// failure mode is silent: it inherits whatever the default happens to be.
//
// This exists because enumerated command lists drift as the CLI grows, which is exactly the
// problem behaviors were introduced to avoid. The behaviors stay semantic; this check makes
// sure a NEW namespace can't slip past unclassified.
