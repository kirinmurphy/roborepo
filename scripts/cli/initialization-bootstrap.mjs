// Shared procedural first-run bootstrap for `roborepo init` and `roborepo web`.
//
// `init` and `web` are the two public first-run entry points and they must produce the same
// machine state: workspace/state roots exist, supported harnesses were discovered and their state
// persisted, and the initialization record says `complete`. Historically only `init` ran these
// steps; `web` started the portal directly, so `npm install` → `roborepo web` reached a portal on
// a machine that had never been procedurally initialized.
//
// This module is the one implementation of that procedural bootstrap. `initCommand()` (initialize.mjs)
// and `serveCommand()` (telemetry.mjs) both call `ensureInitialized()` and decide their own
// presentation — this module never prints. That keeps the two entry points from drifting apart and
// avoids one reaching into the other (no `init`-calls-`web` or `web`-calls-`init` recursion).
//
// PERFORMING the bootstrap and FINALIZING the record are deliberately separate steps, because the
// two entry points finalize at different points:
//
//   - `ensureInitialized()` performs or resumes the procedural bootstrap and leaves the record
//     `in-progress`. It never marks the record complete on its own.
//   - `finalizeInitialization()` marks the record `complete`. `web` calls it immediately after the
//     bootstrap, because starting the portal is its intended first-run destination. `init` calls it
//     only after its browser/CLI configuration step succeeds, so an interrupted or failed
//     configuration leaves the record `in-progress` and the next `init` resumes instead of
//     reporting "already initialized".
//
// The operation is idempotent:
//
//   | Starting record  | ensureInitialized() result | finalizeInitialization() |
//   | ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
//   | missing          | bootstrapped (in-progress) | → complete               |
//   | in-progress      | resume bootstrap (in-progress, preserves startedAt) | → complete |
//   | complete         | noop (unless `force`)      | no-op (already complete) |
//   | newer schema     | refuse without overwriting | — (never reached)        |
//
// Return values are structured (`status`, `phase`, `detected`, `steps`) so callers decide what, if
// anything, to print. `--dry-run` reports the same steps without writing state; `web` never passes
// it. `--force` (init only) re-runs the procedural bootstrap on an already-complete record.
