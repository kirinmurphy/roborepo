// process never re-reads .mjs files after a later git pull/merge changes them on disk, so it can
// keep serving stale portal code indefinitely with no visible sign anything is wrong. The server
// computes this once at startup and reports it via /api/portal/status; a new `serve`/`web`
// invocation recomputes it fresh from the current checkout and compares (see resolvePortalPort in
