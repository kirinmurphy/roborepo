// Development-checkout-only tooling. Everything here operates on `local/`, which package.json's
// `files` never publishes — so in an npm install the scripts these commands drive do not exist.
//
// WHY A GATE IS STILL NEEDED: manifests/ DOES ship. The command definitions for `roborepo dev *`
// therefore reach an npm user even though local/ does not, and without a check they would fail with
// a bare `missing script:` path error. requireDevelopmentCheckout() turns that into a clear
// statement of why the command is unavailable.
//
// NOT THE SAME AS `kind: "internal"`. That flag is about VISIBILITY — internal commands are hidden
// from menus and help but still run fine on end-user machines (`setup`, `bundle`, `onboard-intro`
// are all install-time commands that must). This module is about AVAILABILITY: these commands
// cannot work off a dev checkout at all. Orthogonal axes; easy to conflate.
