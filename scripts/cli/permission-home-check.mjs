// WHY THIS EXISTS: the tracked generated/<provider>/ artifact renders with a fixed placeholder home
// (scripts/build/render-agent-permissions.mjs) so a fake-HOME test run cannot rewrite it. That same
// artifact is rootConfigBaseline (scripts/cli/paths.mjs) — install and apply merge it into the
// user's real home, and Claude's merge UNIONS permission arrays (scripts/cli/root-config-merge.mjs).
// A placeholder home therefore survives into every real machine as a rule pointing at a directory
// that does not exist, and because the merge is additive no later render can remove it.
//
// The manifest ships home-relative scope paths ("~/projects/**") and only the RENDER makes them
// absolute, so any absolute home prefix in a live file that is not this machine's home is drift.
// Reported per rule so the output names the exact lines to remove.
