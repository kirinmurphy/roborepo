# Install Workflows

## Purpose

Roborepo materializes global harness config onto a machine by copying owned files, rendering rules, and preserving user-authored root config. There is no managed/adopt mode. The only install-time choice is how to handle collisions for mutable root config and other copied paths.

## Workflow Shape

1. Run a dry-run preview when you want to inspect planned paths.
2. Run the installer.
3. Choose collision handling only if the installer finds a conflicting local file.
4. Let onboarding enable optional packages and skills.
5. Verify with `roborepo doctor --installed`.

## Preview

```sh
./scripts/install/main.sh --dry-run
```

Dry-run reports the shell/PATH actions, install state write, base rule render, and base bundle application it would perform. It does not mutate home config.

## Install

```sh
./scripts/install/main.sh
```

The installer writes:

- rendered base rules to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- copied roborepo-owned files such as markers, commands, hooks, and Codex rules
- copied root config baselines when no local file exists
- `builtin-support` in each installed harness skill directory
- `~/.local/bin/roborepo`
- install state at `~/.roborepo/install-state.json`

Then it applies the default `base` bundle. Choosing the optional behaviors is `roborepo init`'s job, not the installer's. On update, that base bundle still re-applies so rendered rules stay fresh even on an already-initialized machine.

## Collision Policy

`--on-conflict` controls what happens when an existing local file differs from the repo source:

| Policy | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `keep` | Leave the existing file active and stage the repo candidate beside it as `*_update_TIMESTAMP`. |
| `overwrite` | Move the existing file to `*_original_TIMESTAMP`, then copy the repo file into place. |
| `abort` | Stop instead of changing the conflicting path. |

Example:

```sh
./scripts/install/main.sh --on-conflict keep
```

When no policy is supplied, the installer uses the saved `onConflict` value from `~/.roborepo/install-state.json`. On a first noninteractive run it defaults to `keep`.

## Rules Rendering

Home rules files are generated from base fragments plus enabled package rule fragments. The enabled-package registry lives at:

```text
~/.roborepo/enabled-packages.json
```

Commands that change package state update the registry and re-render the home rules files:

```sh
roborepo package enable jcodemunch
roborepo package disable jcodemunch
roborepo rules --check
```

## Optional Packages

Base install is intentionally minimal. Optional behavior appears only after onboarding or explicit package enablement:

- `jcodemunch` and `jdocmunch` register MCP servers, hooks, permissions, and rule fragments.
- `telemetry` installs capture state through its service component.
- packages with skill components materialize skills into `~/.roborepo/skills/<name>` and link the
  harness skill dirs to that cache.

## Update

```sh
roborepo update
```

`roborepo update` re-runs the installer against the current repo source, refreshes copied files, re-renders rules from the registry, and keeps the saved conflict policy unless `--on-conflict` overrides it.

After a successful update it prints a concise change report, for example:

```text
changed: rules claude
changed: skill builtin-support
unchanged: package registry
```

## Uninstall

Removal has **two owners**:

| Step | Removes | Owned by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `roborepo uninstall` | RoboRepo-managed harness configuration and machine-local state, then the npm application in package mode | RoboRepo, then npm |
| `npm uninstall -g codethings-roborepo-alpha` | the application files npm installed | npm |

On current package installs, run:

```sh
roborepo uninstall
```

**Removing the npm package alone does not remove your RoboRepo configuration, workspace, or the
files RoboRepo projected into your harnesses.** Those live outside the package directory, so npm
does not know about them. Development-checkout mode still skips npm removal because npm does not own
the checkout.

Managed cleanup removes roborepo-owned copied files, rendered rules, managed skill copies, shell
wiring, package projections, and machine-local state. If a genuine pre-install backup exists under
`~/.roborepo/backups/pre-install/`, it is restored. Content that has drifted from what RoboRepo
wrote, and harness files RoboRepo does not own, are left alone and reported.

### Your workspace is preserved

By default your workspace survives, including the common case where it sits at
`~/.roborepo/workspace` inside the state directory:

```sh
roborepo uninstall            # workspace preserved
roborepo uninstall --dry-run  # preview; changes nothing
```

To remove it as well, ask explicitly:

```sh
roborepo uninstall --delete-workspace
```

Two limits on that flag, both deliberate:

- It applies only to a workspace **inside** the RoboRepo state directory. A workspace you relocated
  with `roborepo workspace use <path>` is never deleted by RoboRepo, even with the flag — RoboRepo
  did not create that location, so removing it is yours to do.
- Combined with `--dry-run` it still previews rather than deletes.

Noninteractive runs refuse to remove anything unless you pass `--yes`, so a script cannot delete
your configuration by accident:

```sh
roborepo uninstall --yes
```

The portal exposes the same managed cleanup at `/config` → **Maintenance**, with a preview and an
explicit confirmation. The browser action is preserve-only: there is no workspace-deletion control
there, because that is a deliberate typed choice rather than a button.

## Verification

```sh
roborepo doctor --installed
roborepo doctor --installed
```

`doctor --installed` checks the active machine state, including rendered home rules and base skill copies.

## New-Mac Package Install

This is a separate workflow from the checkout-based install above. Use it when you want to get
`roborepo` running on a new Mac from a real npm package artifact, before that Mac has a clone of
this repository. Keep the bare `roborepo` command pointing at the packaged snapshot. Use package-mode
commands such as `roborepo config apply` to materialize live configuration.

Maintainers repeating development-vs-package environment permutations: see
[Test Scenarios](../../internal/test-scenarios.md).

### 1. On the old Mac: build and verify a transfer artifact

From a clean checkout (no uncommitted changes — the tool refuses otherwise, since the artifact's
recorded source commit must match the bytes it ships):

```sh
npm run prepare:new-mac-install -- --output-dir ~/roborepo-transfer
```

This packs the real npm tarball, installs it into an isolated prefix and temporary home (nothing
touches your real `~/.roborepo` or global npm), and runs `version`, `setup`, `workspace status`,
`config apply`, and `doctor` against it. Only after all of that passes does it write three files
into `~/roborepo-transfer` (real npm-generated names, e.g. `codethings-roborepo-alpha-0.1.0-beta.0.tgz`):

- `<tarball-name>.tgz` — the tarball that passed every check
- `<tarball-name>.tgz.sha256` — its checksum
- `install-manifest.json` — package name/version, the exact git commit it was built from, and
  which commands it was verified against

It also prints the exact commands you'll need next, with the real filenames filled in. Keep that
output, or just re-read the filenames from `install-manifest.json` and follow the steps below.

### 2. Transfer `~/roborepo-transfer` to the new Mac

AirDrop, USB drive, `scp`, whatever moves files between the two machines. Copy the whole directory
so the tarball and its checksum stay together.

### 3. On the new Mac: verify and install

```sh
cd ~/roborepo-transfer   # wherever you copied it to
shasum -a 256 -c <tarball-name>.tgz.sha256
npm install -g ./<tarball-name>.tgz
```

The checksum check confirms the transfer didn't corrupt the file. `npm install -g` installs it
globally, the same way a published package would install — `roborepo` is now on your `PATH`
without a repo checkout anywhere on this machine.

Then set it up for first use:

```sh
roborepo web
```

The first `roborepo web` performs the same procedural setup `init` does — it creates the workspace
and state directories, detects installed harnesses, records initialization, and starts the portal.
It should succeed with no harness binaries installed and no native harness home/config created yet
— zero detected harnesses is a valid outcome. `roborepo init` is the explicit alternative that adds
the browser-or-CLI configuration chooser before opening the portal.

Confirm the result:

```sh
roborepo version
roborepo workspace status
roborepo harness list
roborepo doctor
```

The lower-level primitives (`setup`, `harness refresh`, `config apply`) still exist and are what
the automated package smoke test drives, but a person setting up a machine only needs `init`.

### 4. Roll back if needed

```sh
npm uninstall -g codethings-roborepo-alpha
```

### 5. Observe harness discovery

Use this as an observation sequence for the real new-machine test:

1. Install RoboRepo with no harnesses installed.
2. Run:
   ```sh
   roborepo version
   roborepo setup
   roborepo workspace status
   roborepo harness refresh
   roborepo harness list
   roborepo config apply
   roborepo doctor
   ```
3. Install one harness binary, but do not launch it yet.
4. Run `roborepo harness refresh`, `roborepo harness list`, and `roborepo doctor`; record what
   RoboRepo sees.
5. Launch that harness once so it creates its native home/config.
6. Run `roborepo harness refresh`, `roborepo harness list`, `roborepo config apply`, and
   `roborepo doctor` again; record the difference.

This is only an observation sequence. It does not expand harness presence signals or implement a
new provider behavior.

### 6. Clone for development later

Clone the repository only after the packaged baseline works. Do not run the checkout installer just
to materialize harness config; doing that can replace or shadow the packaged global command with a
checkout symlink.

```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd roborepo
./bin/roborepo version
```

Use:

- `roborepo` for the globally installed package snapshot;
- `./bin/roborepo` for development code from the checkout.

Both entry points may write the same live `~/.roborepo` and harness config. Check which code path
ran with `roborepo version` or `./bin/roborepo version` before comparing behavior.
