# Telemetry

Telemetry is RoboRepo's local, opt-in usage analysis system. It captures per-tool-call facts from
Claude and Codex hooks, turns them into deterministic conclusions (token spikes, testing behavior,
loops, cost breakdowns), and lets a user mark configuration changes and compare sessions before and
after them. Everything lives in local JSONL/JSON files under the RoboRepo state directory; nothing
leaves the machine.

## Capture

`roborepo telemetry capture --harness <claude|codex> --event <HookEvent>` is the hot hook path,
wired into `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `Stop`. It lives in
its own minimal-import module (`scripts/cli/telemetry-capture.mjs`) so every hook invocation does not
pay to load the portal/config/analysis dependency graph — a `node` cold-start just to append one
JSONL line. Each capture (schema v3) carries:

- timestamp, harness, event, session ID;
- hashed working directory and repository identity (root hash, remote hash, branch, short SHA);
- tool metadata (name, MCP server/tool, command hash/size, file extension/path hash — never a raw
  command or path);
- best-effort call-paired duration (`call_id`-keyed, so concurrent/nested calls never clobber each
  other's start stamp);
- a reference to the session's effective configuration snapshot (`config_snapshot_id`);
- a semantic `operation` classification (category/runner/scope/target/exit-status/failure-signature —
  never the raw shell command);
- an inferred `phase` (discovery/implementation/debugging/verification/finalization/unknown, with
  confidence and classifier version);
- `intervening`-work signals (edit-since-last-test, changed-file count/categories, diff fingerprint
  change, targeted-test-since-last-full, failure-signature change) — all hashes/booleans/counts,
  never diff content;
- transcript-derived token counts, prompt size/hash/preview, and the tool result size that most
  recently entered context (size only, never content).

Records are appended to per-harness JSONL spools (`telemetry/spool/<harness>.jsonl`), capped at
~25MB each (oldest lines trimmed, newest ~70% kept). Schema-v2 records (pre-Phase-3) remain readable
— every reader treats the spool structurally rather than gating on `.schema`.

## Markers

A marker is an immutable, append-only event: `change`, `phase`, `outcome`, `experiment-start`,
`experiment-end`, or `note`. Corrections append a new marker referencing the original via
`supersedes` rather than editing history.

```sh
roborepo telemetry mark --type change --title "Prevent full-suite debugging loops" \
  --package test-harness --skill test-harness \
  --metric test.full_suite_calls_per_debug_phase --expect decrease
```

`--type` and `--title` are required. Repeatable/optional flags: `--package`, `--skill`, `--tag`,
`--metric`, `--expect increase|decrease|no-change`, `--description`, `--session`, `--phase` (phase
markers only), `--status` (outcome markers only — `successful`/`partial`/`failed`/`abandoned`/
`unknown`), `--supersedes`, and for outcome markers `--task-category`, `--files-touched`,
`--directories-touched`, `--insertions`, `--deletions`. Repository, branch, SHA, timestamp, and a
deduplicated configuration snapshot are always resolved automatically — a caller cannot override
machine-derived identity fields.

An outcome marker is the only place `Stop` alone is never treated as success: outcome must be set
explicitly. Task category/scale on an outcome marker are `explicit` when set via the CLI; a separate
inference path (`telemetry-task-infer.mjs`) exists for analysis-time use but has no live caller today.

## Experiments

```sh
roborepo telemetry experiment start --title "Test-harness guidance v2" \
  --metric test.full_suite_calls_per_debug_phase --expect decrease \
  --guardrail outcome.completion_rate --minimum-sessions 10

roborepo telemetry experiment end <experiment-id>
roborepo telemetry experiment status [<experiment-id>]
```

`start` creates an experiment definition and its `experiment-start` marker together. `end` appends
an `experiment-end` marker and links it. `status` reports lifecycle state, definition, cohort sizes,
effect size, confidence, and whether the result is `ready` — never a provisional winner. Readiness
means: the primary metric computed for both the before/after cohort around the experiment's start
marker, both cohorts meet `eligibility.minimum_sessions_per_cohort` (default 10), and no serious
data-quality issue was flagged (one session dominating a cohort, or excluded sessions).

## Configuration snapshots

Snapshots are content-addressed (`cfg_<24-hex>`, hashed from normalized packages/rules/skills/hooks/
commands/feature-flags — session-specific fields like `harness`/`model`/`created_at` are excluded
from the hash) and deduplicated on write. Built once per session at `SessionStart` (dynamic-imported
only on that event, to keep the hot capture path's import graph small) and referenced by every later
capture in that session. `readConfigSnapshot()` has documented gaps (no full hook command strings, no
MCP server registration detail, no parsed Codex `config.toml`) — snapshots record these as
`unavailable` dimensions rather than guessing.

## Cohorts, metrics, and comparisons

**Metrics registry** (`scripts/cli/telemetry-metrics.mjs`) is the single source of truth for every
metric formula, unit, and directionality used by the CLI report, the portal, alerts, and experiments
— UI components never define their own formulas. 26 metrics across six groups: tokens, time, calls,
testing, outcome, reliability. Each metric declares `direction_good` (`lower`/`higher`/`neutral`) and
a `minimum_sample` below which a value is technically computable but should be treated as
low-confidence. Robust summaries (trimmed mean, median, percentile) are used for heavy-tailed
token/duration distributions rather than plain averages.

**Cohort filter** (`scripts/cli/telemetry-cohort.mjs`) is a normalized object shared by the CLI and
portal: `time`, `harnesses`, `models`, `repos`, `packages`/`skills` (exposure, resolved via
`config_snapshot_id`), `operations`, `phases`, `outcomes`, `task_categories`, `snapshot_ids`. The same
filter object scopes every panel — no panel-local filter silently redefines the global cohort.

**Marker-relative comparison** (`scripts/cli/telemetry-compare.mjs`) is the preferred way to answer
"did this change something": given a `change` marker, sessions are split into before/after cohorts
(sessions spanning the marker are excluded), equalized (equal session count or equal duration), and
compared per metric. Every comparison reports cohort sizes, excluded-session reasons, effect size,
and a confidence label:

- **strong signal** — both cohorts ≥20 sessions, no serious data-quality issue;
- **emerging pattern** — computable, but below the strong-signal session floor;
- **insufficient evidence** — either cohort below the minimum session count, or the metric didn't
  compute;
- **data-quality warning** — one session dominates a cohort (>40% of its captures), or sessions were
  excluded for spanning the marker.

The older earlier-vs-later **midpoint regression** (`telemetry-analyze.mjs`'s `regression()`) is
retained as a labeled *exploratory fallback* for when no marker is selected — the portal and CLI both
mark it `exploratory: true` and describe it as not tied to any specific change.

Every comparative finding follows the same **actionable finding contract**: observation, evidence
(cohort sizes, effect size), interpretation (explicitly labeled `"labeled_as": "inference"`), next
action, confidence, data-quality issues, and a ready-to-apply `analysis_filter_state` so the portal's
"open analysis" action reproduces the exact cohort/metric. No finding ever claims a package, skill, or
rule *caused* a result — wording stays at "exposed to" / "correlates with."

## Package telemetry policies

A package's `package.config.json` may declare `telemetry.policies`: `[{ metric, operator, value,
minimum_samples, severity }]`. `scripts/cli/telemetry-policy.mjs` validates policy shape (known
metric id, valid operator, numeric threshold) and evaluates a policy against a computed metric value
+ sample size, returning `satisfied` / `violated` / `insufficient-samples` / `unknown`. Policies are
advisory only — nothing in this system blocks a command or tool call. No package in this repository
declares policies yet; the mechanism is generic and ready for a package to adopt.

## CLI report

`roborepo telemetry report` (add `--deep` for an optional LLM synthesis of the deterministic facts —
never raw spool/transcript content) prints, in order: deterministic insights (each with confidence
and a next action), data-quality warnings, read warnings, recent markers, experiment readiness, usage
windows, testing efficiency, cost breakdowns, midpoint regression (labeled exploratory), loops,
sessions, spikes, and raw contributor tables. The same `analyzeTelemetry()` function and metric
registry back both this report and the portal, so CLI and portal numbers agree for the same cohort.

## Portal

The v1 dashboard (`/tokens_v1`, hidden from nav) is a frameworkless, dependency-free page
(`portal/telemetry/`) polling `/api/data` every 5 seconds. The nav-visible `/tokens` page
(`portal/tokens2/`) reads the same `/api/data` report. See `docs/user/reference/portal.md` for the shared portal architecture (loopback bind,
mutation-token contract, route dispatch). Telemetry-specific pieces:

- **Global cohort filter bar** — time range, harness, model, repository, and a marker-relative
  comparison selector. Serializes into the URL (`?range=`, `&end=`, `&harness=`, `&model=`, `&repo=`,
  `&marker_id=`) so a filtered view can be bookmarked, copied, and restored on reload.
- **Timeline marker overlay** — markers render as colored vertical lines (by type) on the token-usage
  chart; overlapping markers cluster; hover shows title/timestamp/SHA/packages/skills/metric; click
  opens marker detail, with a "compare across this marker" action for `change` markers.
- **Action-item panel** — each deterministic insight shows severity, confidence, headline, detail,
  next action, and an "open analysis" button that expands the Analysis explorer pre-filled with that
  finding's metric/marker.
- **Testing-efficiency panel** — leads with the most actionable abnormality (redundant full-suite
  reruns without an intervening edit), then a compact metrics table.
- **Analysis explorer** (`portal/telemetry/analysis-explorer.js`) — a collapsed-by-default drawer for
  high-cardinality comparisons the global filter bar deliberately does not expose: pick a metric from
  the registry, compare across a marker or between two independently-filtered cohorts, see the result
  with the same confidence/data-quality treatment as everywhere else.
- **Session detail** — extended with model history, the session's configuration snapshot (id +
  packages/skills), a phase timeline, semantic operation totals, its explicit outcome/task category
  (marked `source: "explicit"`, since no live inference caller exists yet), markers within a 15-minute
  window of the session, and data-quality flags — alongside the existing "surface chat context" /
  copy-prompt / transcript-open actions, which are unchanged.
- **Marker creation** — a dialog reachable from the cohort filter bar ("+ mark change") posts through
  the same validation/persistence path as the CLI (`createMarker` in `telemetry-markers.mjs`); no
  browser-side duplication of marker rules.

## API

- `GET /api/data?range=&end=&harness=&model=&repo=&marker_id=` — the full analysis report, cohort-
  scoped. Response includes `available_harnesses`/`available_models`/`available_repos`/
  `available_metrics`, window-scoped `markers`, `experiments`, `testing_efficiency`, `cohort`
  (present when a model/repo filter is active), and `marker_comparison` (present when `marker_id`
  resolves).
- `GET /api/session?id=&harness=&finding=&repo=` — bridges a flagged event to its transcript, plus
  `spool_context` (model history, config snapshot, phase timeline, operation totals, outcome, nearby
  markers, data-quality flags) derived from the spool alone, present even when the transcript itself
  is not found on disk.
- `GET /api/insights-llm` — on-demand LLM synthesis of deterministic facts (may take seconds).
- `GET/POST /api/telemetry/markers` — list or create a marker. POST reuses `createMarker()`.
- `GET/POST /api/telemetry/experiments`, `POST /api/telemetry/experiments/:id/end` — list, start, or
  end an experiment. Reuse `startExperiment()`/`endExperiment()`.
- `POST /api/telemetry/analysis` — `{ metric, marker_id }` for a marker-relative comparison, or
  `{ metric, cohort_a, cohort_b }` for a direct two-cohort comparison (no before/after language — no
  shared timestamp to split sessions around). Validates the metric id against the registry and
  returns `400` for an unknown one along with the full known-metric list.
- `GET /api/telemetry/guide` — server-rendered `docs/user/guides/telemetry.md`, backing the page's
  "view docs" popup (`portal/shared/doc-guide-modal.js`) so the popup and the on-disk guide are
  the same content, never a second copy. `renderMarkdown()` (`scripts/cli/markdown-render.mjs`)
  gives every heading a stable slug `id` so a panel's info icon can deep-link straight to its
  section; fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks render as diagrams through the locally vendored mermaid
  runtime (`portal/shared/markdown-mermaid.js`), loaded lazily on first use.

All mutating routes are POST-only and use the portal's standard loopback-origin + mutation-token
guard (see `docs/user/reference/portal.md`).

## Privacy

Telemetry never stores full prompts, shell commands, tool results, transcripts, or absolute paths by
default — only hashes, lengths, categories, and bounded previews (a 200-character prompt preview; a
4000-character *transient* failure-text buffer used only to compute a failure-signature hash, never
persisted). Estimated token/cost figures (~4 chars/token) are clearly distinguished from real
provider-reported counters. `telemetry export`/`backup`/`purge` cover markers, snapshots, and
experiments alongside the spool; `purge --backup` remains recoverable. The portal server binds to
loopback only.

## Retention

Every telemetry store trims itself as it is written. Nothing runs on a schedule, and no data is
removed while you are not using the tool.

| Store | Path under `<stateRoot>` | Bound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capture spool | `telemetry/spool/<harness>.jsonl` | 25MB per harness |
| Markers | `telemetry/events/markers.jsonl` | 5MB |
| Configuration snapshots | `telemetry/snapshots/` | 5MB total |
| Experiments | `telemetry/experiments/` | 5MB total |

None of these expire by age. The spool is the durable record rather than a queue — nothing drains it
after analysis — so an old capture is still the only copy of that session, and only size bounds it.

Two behaviors are worth knowing:

- **Trims overshoot.** A store at its cap drops to roughly 70% rather than to exactly the cap, so a
  trim happens rarely instead of on every subsequent write.
- **A running experiment is never removed.** An experiment with no `end_marker_id` is still live and
  its end marker will reference it, so only finished experiments are eligible for eviction.

Markers, snapshots, and experiments sit three to four orders of magnitude below their caps in normal
use; those bounds exist to stop a runaway, not to manage everyday growth.

Inspect current sizes, or reclaim space early, with:

```
roborepo maintenance stores
roborepo maintenance stores reset telemetry-spool-claude
roborepo maintenance stores reset telemetry-spool-claude --all
```

`reset` applies the store's own policy; `--all` clears it outright. `telemetry purge --all` remains
the way to remove every telemetry store at once, and `purge --backup` keeps a recoverable copy.

## Schema versions

| Record | Schema field | Current version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capture | `schema` | 3 | v2 records remain readable; readers never gate on `.schema`. |
| Marker | `schema` | 1 | |
| Configuration snapshot | `schema` | 1 | Content-addressed id (`cfg_<24-hex>`). |
| Experiment | `schema` | 1 | |
