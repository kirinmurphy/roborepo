# roborepo CLI

`roborepo` is the single command for everything a consumer of this harness does — setting up the
core install on a machine, choosing preset bundles, day-to-day indexing, working with skills, and
maintenance. It replaces the old one-off commands (`harness_helper`, `harness-run`, `jcmindex`,
`jcmwatch`, `jdmindex`, `harness-install-local-skills`), so there is one name to remember and one
entry on `PATH`.

It is a Node program invoked via the `bin/roborepo` shim, installed to `~/.local/bin/roborepo`.
`scripts/cli/main.mjs` is a thin orchestrator (usage, interactive menu, dispatch table); the
subcommand implementations live under `scripts/cli/`, one module per category:

| Module | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/cli/skills.mjs` | `skill adopt`, `skill inspect`, `skill native`, `skill export-to-project`, `skill link-project` |
| `scripts/cli/skill-inventory.mjs` | read-only skill inventory used by `skill inspect` and `/config` source popups |
| `scripts/cli/index.mjs` | `index code\|docs`, `index code --watch`, `run` |
| `scripts/cli/mcp.mjs` | `mcp add` (Claude + Codex registration) |
| `scripts/cli/presets.mjs` | `library` / `package manage` (one shared `packageLibrary` execution preset), `bundle status\|apply\|check\|remove` |
| `scripts/cli/initialize.mjs` | `init` — orchestrates setup, harness discovery, the Package Library handoff, and apply |
| `scripts/cli/initialization-state.mjs` | reads/writes `<stateRoot>/initialization.json`; owns the missing / in-progress / complete distinction |
| `scripts/cli/first-run-routing.mjs` | decides whether a bare `roborepo` enters `init`; pure function of (argv, phase, tty) |
| `scripts/cli/telemetry.mjs` | `web`, `telemetry install\|start\|stop\|enable\|disable\|status\|report\|export\|backup\|purge\|capture` |
| `scripts/cli/telemetry-transcript.mjs` | parse harness transcript -> token/tool/MCP session stats + tool-result sizes |
| `scripts/cli/telemetry-analyze.mjs` | sessions, spikes, spike causes, token contributors, usage windows, spike-vs-normal |
| `scripts/cli/portal-server.mjs` + `portal/` | loopback-only web portal routes and static assets |
| `scripts/cli/paths.mjs` | shared `repoRoot` / `sharedSkillsDir` |
| `scripts/cli/skill-lib.mjs` | shared Node core (zip, prompts, symlink helpers) |

Pure `node:` built-ins — no external `zip`/`unzip`/`ln` — so it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows
(Git Bash). On Windows without Git Bash, call the Node entry directly:
`node <repo>/scripts/cli/main.mjs <args>`.

## Install and PATH

`roborepo` is wired automatically by the installer — there is no manual PATH step on macOS/Linux.
`scripts/install/install-global-commands.sh` (run by `scripts/install/main.sh`, and again by every
`roborepo update`):

1. symlinks `bin/roborepo` into `~/.local/bin/roborepo`, and
2. appends `export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"` to your shell profile if it is not already
   present (idempotent).

Open a new shell (or `source` your profile) after the first install, then `roborepo` resolves from
anywhere.

The installer picks the profile from your `$SHELL`, choosing the file your shell actually sources
on a new terminal:

- **zsh** → `~/.zshrc`
- **bash** → `~/.bash_profile` on macOS (Terminal launches login shells), `~/.bashrc` on Linux
  (interactive shells); prefers whichever already exists
- **other** → `~/.profile` if it exists; otherwise the installer does **not** guess — it prints the
  exact line to add (e.g. `fish_add_path ~/.local/bin`) rather than writing a file the shell never
  reads

A missing profile file is created. Set `ROBOREPO_SHELL_PROFILE=/path/to/profile` to override
the choice.

Windows + PowerShell is the one case that needs a manual PATH addition (the POSIX installer cannot
edit a PowerShell profile): add `~/.local/bin` via System Environment Variables or your
`$PROFILE`, then restart the shell.

**Confirm it worked:** `roborepo doctor` checks that `roborepo` actually resolves on `PATH`, not
just that the symlink exists. If the command is installed but not yet on `PATH` (a fresh install
before opening a new shell, or a Windows manual add that hasn't taken effect), doctor prints a
`warn:` with the exact `export PATH=...` line and tells you to open a new shell. Re-run
`roborepo doctor` to verify.

## Interactive menu

Running `roborepo` with no arguments opens an interactive menu. On an interactive terminal it is
arrow-key driven (↑/↓ to move, Enter to select, Esc/`q`/Ctrl-C to cancel); on a non-interactive
terminal (a pipe, CI, a dumb terminal) it falls back to a numbered list read from stdin. Items are
grouped into sections by significance, each with a short description:

`[path]` is optional everywhere it appears: it defaults to the current directory and may be
relative or absolute — roborepo resolves it to an absolute path before use.

### Categories

- **Setup** — `setup` initializes the portable workspace and machine-local state roots. `apply`
  materializes harness config from the immutable app root plus workspace/state roots. In package
  mode, `update` is a compatibility alias for `apply` and does not download packages. In development
  checkout mode, `update` re-applies the core harness config on this machine (refreshes copied files,
  rendered rules, root config export, command install, and shell install to pick up new config).
  The *first* install is the shell bootstrap `scripts/install/main.sh` — that is what puts
  `roborepo` on `PATH` — so the CLI has no separate `install` verb; once `roborepo` exists you only
  ever `update`. After that, `init` runs the first-run workflow, and `library` reopens the chooser
  to change the optional behaviors for this machine later.
- `version` prints the package version plus resolved `appRoot`, `workspaceRoot`, and `stateRoot`.
  `workspace status` prints the same roots plus workspace manifest state. `workspace use <path>`
  selects a Git-portable workspace. `workspace validate` checks typed workspace resources. `workspace
  import <path>` copies obvious custom additions from an existing checkout into the workspace and
  reports changed built-ins separately without modifying the source checkout.
- `repair` relinks stale symlinks after the checkout was moved or renamed. It does not re-copy
  managed content files/dirs; those stay put. `repair local-config --dry-run` inspects recoverable
  Claude/Codex local settings when `update` or `doctor --installed` reports local config repair
  candidates; `--apply` writes the repaired active files after creating repair backups. Use
  `--on-conflict` only for noninteractive command
  recovery.
- **Day to day** — `index code|docs` are one-shot indexers owned by packages; `index code --watch` runs a live indexer (and
  writes the pidfile the Claude SessionStart hook reads to report watcher status); `mcp add`
  registers MCP servers with Claude + Codex; `bundle` manages the optional bundle selections;
  `telemetry enable`/`disable` turn capture on and off, `web --detach` opens the
  detached portal, and `telemetry install` handles a telemetry-only install; `run` executes a
  command and prints only a trimmed tail of its output.
- **Skills** — `skill new` scaffolds a package-owned automatic helper, skill-backed command, or
  standalone command and updates the package config, generated links, generated slash commands, and
  README rows. `skill adopt` moves an unmanaged native skill into shared roborepo source. `skill
  export-to-project` bundles the shared skills into a `.zip` and copies them into the current
  project's `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` folders with per-skill override/skip (override
  backs the old one up under `archived/`). `skill link-project` treats `.codex/skills/<name>` as
  the project skill source, links Claude project skills to it when `.claude` exists, and prunes
  owned stale links. `skill sync-global` refreshes the machine-local shared skill cache and harness
  links after shared skills are added or removed. `skill inspect <name>` is a read-only native-aware
  inventory report for source ownership, cache state, managed markers, native collisions, native-only
  metadata, and per-harness install state. `skill native` prints a concise native
  Claude/Codex plugin summary for harness-specific actions; add `--full` to print the native help
  output inline. `skill audit` renders/checks the shared skill invocation audit. `skill triggers`
  checks expected and near-miss trigger fixtures from `manifests/inventory/skill-trigger-tests.json`.
  `skill render-commands` renders generated slash commands from package `slash-command` resources,
  and `--check` verifies without changing files. See
  [roborepo Skills Interface](roborepo-skills.md).
- **Maintenance** — `doctor` is the health and post-install check; `rules` renders
  generated Claude/Codex global instruction files, or verifies them with `--check`; `permissions`
  renders Claude/Codex permission outputs from `manifests/inventory/agent-permissions.json`.

## Package-Owned CLI Commands

Some exposed `roborepo` commands are package-owned. The command name is still part of the stable
`roborepo` CLI surface and must be wired in `scripts/cli/main.mjs` plus
`manifests/platform/cli-commands.json`, but the executable recipe lives on a package
`cli-command` resource in `globals/packages/<package>/package.config.json` or an equivalent
workspace package config:

```json
{
  "type": "cli-command",
  "name": "index code",
  "commandOrUrl": "uvx",
  "args": ["jcodemunch-mcp"],
  "mode": "index"
}
```

Use this pattern when the front-door command should stay stable but the implementation belongs to
an enabled package. `roborepo index code`, `roborepo index code --watch`, and `roborepo index docs` follow
this pattern. Running one of these commands resolves the enabled package owner first; if no owning
package is enabled, the CLI tells the user which package to enable.

Lifecycle behavior:

- `roborepo package enable <package-id>` records command ownership in `~/.roborepo/enabled-packages.json`
  for packages with `cli-command` or `rule` resources.
- `roborepo package disable <package-id>` removes that ownership.
- `roborepo doctor` validates command resource shape and duplicate ownership inside package
  dependency closures; `roborepo doctor --installed` checks live install links too.
- `roborepo repair` relinks moved install paths and preserves package command state because the
  command registry is path-independent runtime state. `roborepo maintenance repair local-config --dry-run`
  handles the separate case where local Claude/Codex settings can be safely recovered from backup.
- `roborepo uninstall` removes `~/.roborepo/enabled-packages.json`, so no package command ownership
  survives uninstall.

The lifecycle verbs dispatch to `scripts/install/main.sh`, `scripts/doctor.sh`, and
`scripts/verify-install.sh`; those filenames are an internal detail.
Most maintainer-only scripts (`test-*.sh`) are intentionally not exposed through `roborepo`.
`skill sync-global` and `rules` are exposed because shared-skill and generated-rule editing are
documented maintainer workflows.

## First Run and the Package Library

`roborepo web` is the browser-first entry point: on a fresh install it first runs the shared
procedural bootstrap (the same `ensureInitialized()` that `roborepo init` calls) — creating the
workspace/state roots, refreshing harness discovery, and recording initialization — then opens the
portal. `npm install -g` followed by `roborepo web` is therefore a complete first run with no
separate `init` step.

`roborepo init` remains the explicit alternative first-run workflow: it runs the same procedural
bootstrap, then asks whether to configure settings in the browser or in the CLI. Browser opens
`roborepo web --detach`; CLI continues into the Package Library and applies the resulting
configuration. The initialization record lives at `<stateRoot>/initialization.json` and is the only
thing that distinguishes a never-initialized install from a finished one — directory existence is
not evidence, since `setup` can create the workspace on its own. Both `init` and a first-run `web`
write the same record through the shared bootstrap.

A bare, interactive `roborepo` on an uninitialized install routes into `init`. This is not the old
forced-onboarding gate, which blocked arbitrary commands and has been removed: explicit commands
always run regardless of initialization state, including `doctor`, `version`, and `--help`, and a
bare non-interactive invocation goes to the normal menu so automation is never dropped into a
wizard it cannot answer. An interrupted first run is resumable; a completed one re-runs as a no-op
report rather than replaying the bootstrap.

`roborepo library` (equivalently `roborepo package manage`) is the machine-level chooser for global
harness behaviors. Both names dispatch to one implementation. Re-running it shows enabled options
checked and disabled options unchecked so you can turn a behavior on or off later.

The platform's install-time file operations (root config baselines, command links, hook links, Codex
rules) are applied internally by the install pipeline. There is no user-facing verb for them:
`roborepo update` re-applies them, `roborepo uninstall` reverses them. The internal `roborepo bundle`
verb exists only for `scripts/install/main.sh` and back-compat scripts, and is intentionally absent
from the usage and menu.

The `telemetry` bundle is selected from the same workflow. When enabled, the harness hooks call
`roborepo telemetry capture` on session/tool/prompt/stop events and append one JSON record per event
to `~/.roborepo/telemetry/spool/<harness>.jsonl`. Everything stays local — no record ever leaves the
machine, and the dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

**Opt-in by design.** The capture hooks are package-owned (`globals/packages/telemetry/hooks-{claude,codex}.json`)
and are installed only when the `telemetry` package is enabled; enabling the package does not by
itself turn capture on — the hooks no-op until `roborepo telemetry enable` writes
`~/.roborepo/telemetry/state.json {enabled:true}`. This is deliberate: an always-on spool grows with
every session, so capture is something the user turns on and off explicitly. To keep an enabled spool
bounded, each `<harness>.jsonl` is size-capped
(~25 MB): when exceeded, the oldest records are dropped and the newest ~70% kept (records are
chronological), so the file can't fill the disk.

**Lifecycle — capture and portal.** `roborepo telemetry enable` turns capture on;
`roborepo telemetry disable` turns capture off; `roborepo web`
opens the detached portal. `roborepo web stop` stops the detached server without changing
capture state. The detached server's PID is tracked in
`~/.local/state/roborepo/portal-server.pid`; a stale PID file (process gone) is detected and
cleaned up. `web` can browse historical spool data with capture off.

**Telemetry-only install.** `roborepo telemetry install` formalizes a standalone telemetry setup
without the rest of roborepo: it symlinks `~/.local/bin/roborepo` (if not already present), writes
`state.json {enabled:true}` directly, and wires only the 5 capture hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`
and `~/.codex/hooks.json` — none of the full operational hook set. This is the supported path for
measuring baseline token usage before adopting the full suite; upgrading is just re-running the normal
install. (Note: `telemetry enable` applies the full telemetry *preset* including operational
hooks, which is correct for a full install — `telemetry install` intentionally bypasses that.)

**Codex hook trust.** Codex only runs hooks the user has trusted. After install, the next Codex
session prompts to trust the roborepo-managed `~/.codex/hooks.json` — approve it once and capture (and
the shell-output minimization hook) fire from then on. This is normal Codex UX, not a roborepo step;
sessions started *before* the hooks were installed won't have them (Codex loads hooks at session
start), so a brand-new session is needed the first time. The install does not bypass Codex's
hook-trust gate.

### Record schema

Records are versioned by a `schema` field so the spool stays backward compatible. Legacy records
written before token capture have no `schema` key (treated as v1) and are metadata-only; readers count
them in event totals but skip them in token analysis. Current records are `schema: 2` and add, on top
of the v1 metadata (`ts`, `harness`, `event`, `session_id`, hashed `cwd`/repo identity, `tool`,
`prompt`):

- `tokens` — cumulative session totals at capture time: `input`, `output`, `cache_creation`,
  `cache_read`, `total`. Read from the harness transcript (`transcript_path` on hook stdin), so no
  agent-side instrumentation is needed.
- `delta_tokens` — tokens consumed since the previous capture in the same session. This is the spike
  signal: it isolates a single heavy turn from the cumulative climb.
- `tool.is_mcp` / `tool.mcp_server` — MCP attribution (parsed from `mcp__<server>__<tool>` names).
- `session` — `model`, `assistant_turns`, `tool_calls`, `mcp_calls`, `max_output_tokens`.
- `last_result` / `biggest_result` — spike attribution: the size (`{tool, chars, is_error}`) of the
  tool result that most recently entered the context window, and the heaviest result of the session.
  Sizes and tool names only — result content is never stored, preserving the hash-only privacy model.
  These tie a spike back to *what* drove it (a large file read, an MCP bundle, an unbounded Bash log).

Per-session token cursors live under `~/.roborepo/telemetry/collector/` and back the `delta_tokens`
computation.

`roborepo telemetry backup` snapshots the telemetry tree to a timestamped copy under
`~/.roborepo/telemetry-backups/` (which lives *outside* the telemetry tree, so a later purge cannot
remove it). `roborepo telemetry purge --all` removes the whole telemetry tree; add `--backup` to take
that snapshot first, so a reset is recoverable.

### Reports and the dashboard

`roborepo telemetry report` prints the metadata summary plus, when token-bearing records exist:
a recent-usage estimate (trailing 5h / 7d token totals — a *local* estimate from capture deltas, not
the real server-side rate limit, which telemetry cannot see); a **spike-cause** breakdown that groups
each spike by the pattern that drove it (`mcp-bundle`, `large-file-read`, `unbounded-bash-output`,
`big-prompt`, …) with the change to make; sessions ranked by tokens; detected token spikes (captures
whose `delta_tokens` exceed mean + 2σ); top token contributors by repo / tool / MCP server; and a
spike-vs-normal comparison (average delta, tool calls, MCP rate). The spike-cause classifier keys off
`last_result` size, degrading to tool name for records that predate result-size capture.
`roborepo telemetry export` dumps the raw spool as JSON.

**Conclusions, not just data.** The report leads with a deterministic "what this means" block
(`scripts/cli/telemetry-insights.mjs`) — ranked, plain-English findings derived from threshold rules
over the analysis: native read/grep vs each MCP package's cost-per-call (agnostic — compares
`native-read` against every MCP server present, so it covers any MCP, not just jcodemunch), spike
tail-risk (a group with spike-lift ≫ baseline), the dominant cost center, runaway loops, regression,
and the heaviest single call. Per-tool cost is attributed by **result size** (`last_result.chars` →
approx tokens), not by `delta_tokens`-by-hook, which mis-credits whichever hook fired. `report --deep`
appends an optional LLM synthesis via the headless `claude -p` (the user's existing auth — no API
key); only the computed summary is sent, never raw spool/prompts/results, and it degrades to a note if
`claude` is unavailable. The dashboard mirrors all of this: a top "what this means" panel with a
"deeper read" button, a chart with per-turn-delta / cumulative-per-session / cumulative-by-tool-group
views, and flagged spikes/loops that link back to the originating chat (transcript located by session
id, heaviest turns surfaced, plus a copy-paste analysis prompt).

> Note: MCP tool attribution resolves both the prefixed wire name (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`) and the
> bare tool names Codex sometimes logs (e.g. `search_symbols`), via a known-tool table in
> `telemetry-transcript.mjs` — without it, Codex MCP usage is undercounted.

`roborepo web [--detach] [--no-open] [--port <n>]` (default `4317`) starts a dependency-free local
web portal on `127.0.0.1` and opens the Home page by default (`--detach` forks it into the background and
writes the PID file; this is what `roborepo web` uses under the hood). On a fresh install, before
anything else it runs the shared procedural bootstrap (`ensureInitialized()`) so `npm install -g` →
`roborepo web` initializes and opens the portal in one step; on an initialized install this is a
no-op. Before binding, it probes an
occupied port through `/api/portal/status`, which reports a content hash of the served portal
source: a portal running current code is reused/adopted; one that's still alive but running code
from before a `git pull`/merge (a detached server outlives the CLI invocation that started it, and
Node never re-reads changed `.mjs` files) is killed and restarted on the same port instead of
silently kept; an unhealthy or otherwise-unrecognized listener on the default port causes the new
server to pick an available fallback port instead.
It serves the same analysis as JSON and renders it with a self-contained `<canvas>`
UI: a "what's causing spikes" panel leads with the spike-cause breakdown (each row a behavior to
change), the recent-usage estimate shows in the header, and the token-delta timeline buckets to one
column per pixel client-side, so dense histories with thousands of captures stay fast and the spike
threshold line stays readable. The page re-fetches every few seconds, so a dashboard left open during
a session reflects live captures.

For demos and dashboard development, `node scripts/cli/telemetry-seed-demo.mjs` writes a set of
synthetic sessions (varied models, repos, and spike causes) to a dedicated `spool/demo.jsonl`, picked
up automatically alongside real spools; rerun with `--clear` to remove it. It never touches the real
`claude.jsonl` / `codex.jsonl` spools.

## Permissions

Agent permissions are defined once in `manifests/inventory/agent-permissions.json` as flat behavior
and command buckets. Each bucket resolves to `allow`, `ask`, or `deny`; profile bundles such as
`readonly`, `interactive`, and `workspace` are no longer part of the data model.

```sh
roborepo permissions
roborepo permissions --check
```

The renderer writes Claude and Codex native output from the same manifest:

| Harness | Rendered output |
| --- | --- |
| Claude | `permissions.allow`, `permissions.deny`, and `permissions.ask` in `generated/claude/settings.json` |
| Codex | `approval_policy`, `default_permissions`, permission profile roots, and network setting in `generated/codex/config.toml`, plus shell prefix rules in `generated/codex/rules/default.rules` |

Existing `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/config.toml` are active local root config files, so
rendered baseline changes affect an already installed machine only after `roborepo update` and the
root config merge/export workflow.

## MCP registration

`roborepo mcp add <name-or-url>` wraps the Claude registration step and the Codex config update so
common MCP setup is repeatable instead of hand-typed. After Claude registration succeeds it also:

- adds `mcp__<name>` to active `~/.claude/settings.json` (the settings the harness reads, not the repo
  baseline template) so the server's tools are allowed without repeated approval prompts (skip with
  `--skip-claude-permission`), and
- adds an MCP block to active `~/.codex/config.toml` so Codex can use it immediately.

Default target is every registered harness; repeat `--harness <id>` (e.g. `--harness claude`) to
scope it to a subset. Presets exist for the
two bundled servers (`jcodemunch`, `jdocmunch`, both `uvx`-based); any other non-URL value is
treated as a `uvx` package, and HTTP URLs default to `--transport http` and are written to Codex as
a `url = "..."` block. Use `--dry-run` to print the exact
`claude mcp add ...` command plus the planned Claude-permission and Codex-config writes without
touching anything.

## Tests

`scripts/test/test-cli.sh` smoke-tests the subcommands (skill link-project/sync-global/inspect/prune/uninstall/
conflict, `skill new` scaffolds, native escape-hatch guide, audit check, export/override/firewall/self-pollution guard, slash-command render checks,
`package manage`/`bundle` onboarding/apply/remove/status, `telemetry` enable/status/report, run, `mcp add` dry-runs + real
Codex/Claude writes against a throwaway harness root, lifecycle/rules dispatch, menu fallback) against throwaway
temp repos.
It touches no global state.
