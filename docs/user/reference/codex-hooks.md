# Codex Hooks

Hooks are commands Codex runs at points in a session — when it starts, before a tool call, after a
tool call. RoboRepo installs a few that always run, and packages add more when you enable them.
Turn a package's hooks off by disabling the package in `/config` or with
`roborepo package disable <id>`.

Codex runs only hooks you have trusted. After install, the next Codex session asks you to trust
`~/.codex/hooks.json`; approve it once. Sessions that were already running do not pick up new hooks.

## What Runs

| Event | Hook | What it does | Installed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SessionStart | Unmanaged skills notice | Counts skills in `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills` that RoboRepo does not manage and suggests `roborepo skill adopt <name>` | always |
| SessionStart | Caveman mode | Turns on terse output; say "stop caveman" or "normal mode" to turn it off | `caveman` |
| SessionStart | jcodemunch nudge | Reminds Codex to explore code with jcodemunch tools | `jcodemunch` |
| SessionStart | jdocmunch index check | If `docs/` exists but is not indexed, reminds Codex to run `roborepo index docs docs/` | `jdocmunch` |
| PreToolUse (shell) | Per-command ask | Prompts before shell commands your permission settings put in the `ask` bucket (see below) | always |
| PreToolUse (shell) | Output minimizer | Appends `2>&1 \| tail -n 120` to noisy build, lint, and typecheck commands, forces `tsc --pretty false`, and denies `--watch`, `--verbose`, and `--debug` | always |
| PostToolUse | Skill reference observer | Tells Codex which skill reference files it just read, for the skills-loaded line. Codex does not yet deliver this event after shell reads, so Codex reads are under-counted | `skill-visibility` |
| SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop | Telemetry capture | Records token and tool usage locally | `telemetry`, once `roborepo telemetry enable` is run |

Codex has no `Grep`/`Glob` block or write guard; jcodemunch preference on Codex comes from the
generated rules in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and the command rules in `~/.codex/rules/`.

## Permissions On Codex

Your permission settings (see [Config Control Panel](config-control-panel.md#permissions)) reach
Codex in two layers:

| Bucket | How Codex enforces it |
| --- | --- |
| `allow` / `deny` | A command rule in `~/.codex/rules/default.rules`. These hold even if a hook fails to load |
| `ask` | The per-command ask hook above, since command rules can only allow or forbid |

A command no rule or hook classifies falls through to Codex's `approval_policy`.

`~/.codex/rules/` and `~/.codex/config.toml` are live files that Codex itself can change — for
example, approving "always allow this command" in a session appends a rule. Once they differ from
RoboRepo's version, `roborepo update` leaves them alone unless you choose `--on-conflict overwrite`.
`roborepo config root inspect` reports when `config.toml` has drifted; nothing checks `rules/` for
drift.

See [Hooks Internals](../../internal/hooks-internals.md) for script locations and protocol detail.
