# Claude Hooks

Hooks are commands Claude Code runs at points in a session — when it starts, before a tool call,
after a tool call. roborepo installs a few that always run, and packages add more when you enable
them. Turn a package's hooks off by disabling the package in `/config` or with
`roborepo package disable <id>`.

## What Runs

| Event | Hook | What it does | Installed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SessionStart | Unmanaged skills notice | Counts skills in `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills` that roborepo does not manage and suggests `roborepo skill adopt <name>` | always |
| SessionStart | jcodemunch status | Says whether `roborepo index code --watch` is running for this directory and reminds Claude to explore code with jcodemunch tools | `jcodemunch` |
| SessionStart | jdocmunch index check | If `docs/` exists but is not indexed, reminds Claude to run `roborepo index docs docs/` | `jdocmunch` |
| PreToolUse `Grep`, `Glob` | Search redirect | Blocks the call and tells Claude to use jcodemunch search tools instead | `jcodemunch` |
| PreToolUse `Bash` | Source-exploration block | Blocks shell commands that read source files directly (see below) | `jcodemunch` |
| PreToolUse `Bash` | Output minimizer | Trims noisy build, lint, and typecheck output; denies `--watch`, `--verbose`, and `--debug`; auto-allows a short list of safe read-only commands | always |
| PreToolUse `Bash` | Dense command log | Records commands of three or more lines to `<stateRoot>/capture/claude/dense-bash.jsonl` so you can find ones worth scripting. Never blocks | `capture-dense-bash` |
| PreToolUse `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` | Repository scope | Reads across the repository and its worktrees are quiet; writes outside the checkout in use prompt. See [Config Control Panel](config-control-panel.md#changing-path-scopes) | always |
| PreToolUse `Write`, `Edit` | Write guard | When Claude edits under `~/.claude` or `~/.codex`, adds a reminder about which files roborepo manages. `settings.local.json` is exempt | always |
| PostToolUse `Read` | Skill reference observer | Tells Claude which skill reference files it just read, for the skills-loaded line | `skill-visibility` |
| SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop | Telemetry capture | Records token and tool usage locally | `telemetry`, once `roborepo telemetry enable` is run |

Caveman mode on Claude comes from the `caveman` plugin, not a hook.

## Source-Exploration Block

Blocking `Grep` and `Glob` alone would let Claude shell out to read source instead, so a Bash hook
closes that route. It blocks a command only when **all** of these hold:

- the command is `grep`, `rg`, `ag`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, or `find`
- it names a file path and has no pipe
- the path is inside the repository and has a source extension (`.ts`, `.py`, `.go`, …)
- the path is not under `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `coverage`, or `vendor`

Everything else is allowed, because Bash legitimately does things jcodemunch cannot: grepping a
log, reading a JSON or lock file, piping `git log | grep`. The block message points Claude at the
jcodemunch tool to use instead. It runs before the output minimizer, so its decision is final.
